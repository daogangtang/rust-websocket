				<h2>About Rust-WebSocket</h2>
				<p>Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (<a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6455/">RFC6455</a>) library written in Rust.</p>
				<p>Rust-WebSocket attempts to provide a framework for WebSocket connections (both clients and servers). The library is currently in an experimental state, but can work as a simple WebSocket server or client, with more functionality to come. There is some documentation, but no testing code at the moment, however that is being worked on.</p>
				<p>The project can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/cyderize/rust-websocket">GitHub</a> and on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/websocket">crates.io</a>.</p>

				<h2>Installation</h2>
				<p>To add a library release version from crates.io to a Cargo project, add this to the <code><span class="c3">[dependencies]</span></code> section of your Cargo.toml:</p>
				<pre><code><span class="c1">websocket</span> = <span class="c2">&quot;~0.8.1&quot;</span></code></pre>
				<p>To add the library's Git repository to a Cargo project, add this to your Cargo.toml:</p>
				<pre><code><span class="c3">[dependencies.websocket]</span>

<span class="c1">git</span> = <span class="c2">&quot;https://github.com/cyderize/rust-websocket.git&quot;</span></code></pre>
				<p>And add the line <code><span class="c3">extern crate</span> <span class="c1">websocket</span>;</code> to your main.rs or lib.rs.</p>
				<h2>Current State</h2>
				<p>At the moment, the library provides both client and server WebSocket implementations, however these have not been tested thoroughly.
				There is support for handling WebSocket requests and responses, as well as fragmented messages. Secure WebSocket connections can be used though
				<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl">rust-openssl</a>. Simply pass an SslStream to the WebSocketClient::new() function and use the WebSocketClient as normal.</p>
				<p>There are some unit tests, but more are required (as well as integration test). Eventually, proper compliance with RFC6455 should be tested.</p>
				<h2>Documentation</h2>
				<p>API Documentation for the library can be found <a href="doc/websocket">here</a>. Example usage can be found within the documentation.</p>
				<p>If you have additional enquiries regarding the library or myself, contact me <a href="mailto:admin@cyderize.org">here</a>.
